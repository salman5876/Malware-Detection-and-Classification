## Introduction
IT is a web-based application designed to detect and classify malware from executable (EXE) files. Utilizing machine learning, It can determine if a file contains malware and further classify the type of malware (e.g., virus, trojan, etc.). The application provides detailed insights about the EXE file, including its name, size, entropy, hash, signature, and other features. Additionally, it fetches YARA rules and visual representations of the extracted features.

## Features
- **Malware Detection**: Upload EXE files to detect the presence of malware.
- **Malware Classification**: Classify detected malware into specific types such as virus, trojan, etc.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract and display various features of the EXE file, including name, size, entropy, hash, signature, and more.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize features using graphs.
- **YARA Rules**: Fetch YARA rules for the file.
- **API Integration**: Fetch additional information and images from external APIs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salman5876/Malware-Detection-and-Classification
   cd malscan
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. **Run the Flask application:**:
   `flask run`
   
2. **Access the web application:**
   - Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
     
3. **Upload an EXE file:**
  - On the main page, upload your EXE file.
  - If malware is detected, a "Classify" button will appear.
  - Click on the "Classify" button to classify the type of malware.

## Model Training
Utilizes machine learning models trained as follows:

- **Malware Detection Model**: Trained on a dataset of malware and benign EXE files.
- **Malware Classification Model**: Trained on a dataset with labeled malware types.
- The models follow standard machine learning workflows, including data collection, model training, validation, and cross-validation.

## Web Application
- The web application is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python Flask. The backend processes EXE files, extracts features, and interacts with the machine learning models.

## API Integration
- It integrates with external APIs to fetch additional information and images related to the EXE files.
